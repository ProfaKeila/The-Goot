**Electromechanical Components:**

The robot was built using the LEGO Spike Prime robotics kit. Now, a brief description of each electromechanical component used in the creation of this autonomous robot.

**Motors:**

**Large Angular Rear Motor:** This motor, connected to a gear, enables the rotation of the rear wheels, providing rear traction and torque in movement.

**Medium Angular Front Motor:** This motor is responsible for steering the robot, allowing it to move in different directions.

**Sensors:**

**Ultrasonic Sensor:** 

This sensor is mainly used for distance measurement and object avoidance.

**Color Sensor:**   

It boasts high precision with a sampling frequency of 1kHz, ensuring the acquisition of accurate data for repeatable results. Additionally, it has the capability to detect 8 colors and measure both the intensity of reflected white light and ambient light. Its simple form factor allows for quick assembly and disassembly, making it easy to use and adapt in various situations.

**HuskyLens Camera:**  

Taken as a replacement for the color sensor in the Spike Prime set, it incorporates the latest generation of AI chips and is used for the recognition of color and shape of objects known as obstacles.

**Hub**

It's like an advanced block filled with amazing capabilities, it has 6 ports to connect sensors and motors, a board with 25 customizable lights, as well as the ability to communicate through Bluetooth. In addition, it has a speaker to make noises and a smart 6-axis gyroscope that captures movements in all directions. The battery is rechargeable to keep it running for an extended period before needing to charge it. This device comes with its own operating system, like a brain, which is MicroPython. It can also store up to 20 programs. The built-in lights, arranged in a 5x5 matrix, add an interactive visual touch, while its ability to speak through the speaker and its Bluetooth wireless connection expand the possibilities for fun.
